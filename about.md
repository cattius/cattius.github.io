Hi, I'm Cat.

I translate law and policy into code at [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), where I lead the Privacy Engineering team. I'm also developing an [introductory online course on privacy engineering](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=9409) and keeping one foot (...sometimes it feels like both feet!) in the world of research, exploring technology's impact on society with a focus on privacy and human rights. I'm interested in privacy concerns at every layer of the tech stack, but especially so at the hardware level.

Previously, I explored how to bridge the gap between tech and policy as an [Internet Society Early Career Fellow](https://www.internetsociety.org/fellowships/early-career/fellows/2023/) and [Virtual Routes European Cybersecurity Fellow](https://virtual-routes.org/initiatives/fellowship/), hacked CPUs for a living at [TU Graz's ISEC](https://www.isec.tugraz.at/), dived into Privacy and Civil Liberties Engineering for the first time at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/pcl/), and geeked out over computer architecture and security in my MEng in Computer Science at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/departments/computerscience/).

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll usually find me in the mountains, either knee-deep in snow or gazing in awe at the views! You can check out some of my adventures [here](/adventures).

## Giving What We Can
<div style="float:left;margin-right:15px;"><img src="/images/gwwc.png" alt="A badge from the organization Giving What We Can with the text 'I donate 10% of my income to effective charities'" height="180"></div>

[I've taken the Giving What We Can üî∏ 10% Pledge](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/should-charity-be-anonymous), and I encourage you to do the same if that's financially feasible for you.

If you'd like to donate but don't know how or where to start, [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) has some great resources to help guide you in evaluating which charities can do the most good with your money - and to nudge you to get started!
