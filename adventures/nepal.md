In October-November 2022, Charlie, Phil, and I visited Nepal to hike around 250km in the Khumbu region. Starting in the "lowlands" (still above 2000m!) at Phaplu, we hiked into Lukla, and then joined the main Three Passes Trek route over the Kongma La (5550m), Cho La (5420m), and Renjo La (5360m), with some short detours to Everest Base Camp and Ama Dablam Base Camp before flying out of Lukla. The route is indescribably beautiful and I can't recommend it highly enough. Make sure your knees are ready for >14000m ascent (just kidding, they'll never be ready) and take the altitude seriously. We were surprised at the vastly different paces at which the three of us acclimatised to the altitude, needing to spend 3 days in Chkhung before the first high pass to make sure we could all ascend to 5000m safely.
